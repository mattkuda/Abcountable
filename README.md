## Getting Started

To get this project running on your local machine, follow the steps outlined below.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Node.js & npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)

### Installation & Setup

#### Frontend

1. Clone this repository and navigate into it

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourUsername/yourRepoName.git
   cd yourRepoName
   ```

2. Navigate into the `mobile` directory

   ```bash
   cd mobile
   ```

3. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the application via Expo
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

This will open Expo Dev Tools in the browser. You can then use an emulator or a physical device connected to your machine to run the application.

To build expo, run `eas build --platform ios --profile production`. Use the transfer app to upload the .eas file to the Apple Connect.

#### Backend

1. Navigate back to the root directory and then into the `server` directory

   ```bash
   cd ..
   cd server && cd src
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The server will start running at http://localhost:3000.

## Firebase Service Account Setup

To set up Firebase Admin in your local environment:

1. Rename `firebaseServiceAccountKey.ts.template` to `firebaseServiceAccountKey.ts` in the `/server/src/config` directory.
2. Fill in the placeholders in `firebaseServiceAccountKey.ts` with your actual Firebase service account details.
   - You can find these details in your Firebase project settings under Service Accounts.
3. Ensure that `firebaseServiceAccountKey.ts` is included in your `.gitignore` file to avoid exposing sensitive information.
