This is a Tabata Timer application built with React Native and Expo. A Tabata Timer performs a particular exercise 8 times, separated by rest intervals. You can configure the number of exercises, the duration of each exercise, and the rest interval.

The application provides visual cues for the different states (work, rest, cooldown) with a large, easy-to-read timer countdown. It also displays the number of exercises completed and the total workout time.

## Getting Started

To get this project running on your local machine, follow the steps outlined below.

### Prerequisites
